She is a licensed psychologist by training and holds a PhD in work psychology. Professor Tenhiala has two streams of research. In her first stream, focusing on employee compensation, she is particularly interested in developing our understanding around controversies with respect to pay structure (e.g., pay dispersion, pay disparities), organizational structure (e.g., hierarchies, task interdependence, autonomy), and employee attitudes (e.g., fairness, engagement). She studies peer-based compensation in self-managed organizations, whether pro-equality laws reduce gender pay gap, the impact of pay transparency on motivational climate, among others. Her work in this area has been published in many books and journals such as Strategic Management Journal , Human Resource Management, Human Relations, Organization Studies, Journal of Occupational and Organizational and Psychology . One of her papers, “Perceptions of politics and fairness in merit pay“ received the Emerald Literati Network Award for Excellence. Prof Tenhiala has another, emerging stream of research. She has become increasingly interested in the wellbeing of entrepreneurs, and high-growth entrepreneurs in particular. Using unique records-based database, she studies questions related to the wellbeing of the entrepreneurs and possible dilemmas related to managing their companies and their personal lives. In the classroom, aims at creating a psychologically safe environment where students can discover, experiment, collaboratively contribute, and critically reflect. She is a believer in experiental learning methods, such as using cases as a tool for role-play, self-reflection surveys, and simulation. As a whole, her goal is to provide a student-centered, interactive learning environment, integrate theory with practice, provide a strong foundation for self-directed reflective learning, and strive for constructive alignment.

    "clean_text":"Although graduated as a medical doctor, combines his passion for medicine and business. He is an entrepreneur, cosmetic and hair specialist, and teaching professor of Economics and business. This versatility in adapting to different challenging circumstances sets him apart from others in understanding and adapting to market changes since he himself has had to adapt to changes and reinvent himself. Before finding his first clinic, worked in different senior positions in several companies. Always considered by his peers as an accomplished and results-driven professional, always believed in managing changes to facilitate transitions to new markets and creating solid internal structures responsive to customer expectations. In 2006 he founded his first clinic for others to follow, and since then he has worked as a doctor and cosmetic surgeon. This issue was highly challenging as he has two functions, that of a specialist who gives solutions to the patient, and that of a CEO running clinics that give service to more than 20,000 patients. As a teaching professor, he teaches Economics and Business to a wide range of students at A-level, University, and MBA. As the saying goes, “there is no satisfaction higher than helping others achieve their goals.” Achieving the award for Excellence in teaching on many occasions, he continues to inspire students at all levels. In contrast, his clinics continue to grow giving support to more and more patients looking for the best results.

She then noticed the importance of mental health and the need for this issue to be of special importance, which is the reason that led her to enroll in a Bachelor in Psychology and work the absolute most to create a professional career in this field. She has a special interest in the bonds and relations between an individual and their support system and how these are veloped, which is why she continued her studies in the field of Systemic Therapy. While doing so, another path called her attention in the field of teaching and helping others learn about mental health: not necessarily from a professional perspective only, as she found that the first step to a healthy society is self-knowledge and awareness. She is also specialised in Psychodrama, a therapeutic technique which she finds very helpful while working with emotional issues, both in the clinic and in the classroom. She is currently working in the private practice for clinical psychology, seeing adults and couples in psychotherapy in Madrid; she has experience in leading group therapies, among adults who are looking for a psychotherapy process to look at their inner selves. She is amazed by the velopment of personality and psychological features, connecting these to the family and social environment and concepts as attachment and trauma, where she is currently becoming an expert through her studies in re-processing techniques (such as EMDR) and the neurological consequences of trauma. She has been teaching at universities for over 8 years, paying special attention to the personal experience of learning about oneself and others. She believes in learning through connecting with our emotions and those of others.

Some of her work includes research on entrepreneurs’ overconfidence and ambiguity attitudes toward sources of endogenous and exogenous ambiguity. In particular, ambiguity is ubiquitous in business. The inherent novelty of some business models, such as Google’s, Amazon.com’s or the proliferation of crowdfunding opportunities, impose rapid changes in economic contexts that make it even more difficult to estimate ex-ante the chances of success of investments, new ventures, financing campaigns, the growth potential of firms, or projections of share prices. How do individuals make decisions without knowing the chances of success? Through lab and field experiments, blending theory from economics and psychology, ’s research addresses these issues and provides insights into investors, managers and entrepreneurs’ behavior.

His own research has pushed the frontiers of knowledge in domains like decision making, consumer behavior, human resource management, and sensory marketing. It is based on two pillars: Academic rigor, as demonstrated by publications at premium academic journals (e.g., Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Marketing Research, Human Resource Management, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes). Practical relevance, as shown by his 3 articles at Harvard Business Review (www.hbr.org) – more than any IE professor over the last few years. He considers dissemination and application of behavioral science to academia, business, and society as important as the science itself. His extensive efforts on this front (e.g., to study and apply behavioral insights on handling the COVID-19 pandemic) have received financial support from the European Commission, and the Association for Consumer Research, among others. He also has been involved in business-funded initiatives at IE that apply behavioral science to business and society, such as the Center for Consumer-Driven Growth. Finally, he is the founder of the yearly Mediterranean Symposium on Consumer Behavior Research, and a founding member of the Marketing & Society Research Group at IE. At IE University, Antonis has taught Marketing, Consumer Behavior, and Market Research at the Master’s as well as at the PhD level.

    "clean_text":"Tenhiälä is a Professor of Operations Management at IE Business School. Before joining IE, he earned his doctorate at Helsinki University of Technology and was a Fulbright scholar at the Carlson School of Management at University of Minnesota. ’s research is focused on the planning, coordination, and communication practices that firms use to overcome unexpected events in their processes. The overarching theme in his findings is that universally superior practices do not exist, and practices that are effective in some environments often cause havoc in others. His studies, which have received awards from the Academy of Management, Decision Sciences Institute, and the European Foundation for Management Development, have disclosed factors that critically influence the effectiveness of different planning, coordination, and communication practices. Prior to joining the academia, worked first as a process developer in electronics manufacturing and in the telecommunications infrastructure industry. He then became an independent SAP consultant and instructor, in which position he worked with a number of multinational corporations and educational institutions. In addition, is a reservist in the Finnish Army where he holds the rank of First Lieutenant in an airborne ranger regiment. “In my experience, practicing managers vary greatly in their understanding of how their processes actually work and why their processes behave the way they do. Consequently, the managers either succeed or fail to choose effective management practices. I have witnessed too many ‘best practice’ implementations that have gone awry because of their contextual unfitness. In my view, business education should create awareness of the pitfalls in the one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead of teaching ‘best practices’, we should give the future managers the tools to analyze any given process and choose the management practices that best fit its context-specific requirements”, summarizes his objectives in teaching.

    "clean_text":"Coming to IE with a PhD in political science, Associate Professor tries to bring an understanding of politics behind market actions. His research revolves around one of the central aspects of political economy: when do politicians favor some industries over others, and what are the effects of such favoritism? “Politicians are always favoring some industries over others”, he says, “the question is why? Around the world political & societal context changes how much politicians care about different industries. A firm may be taxed for political benefit in one context, while in another context it will be subsidized”. His research focuses on what structural characteristics, such as voting systems, incentivize politicians to support geographically concentrated or dispersed industries. Further, he believes this research can help us understand why cities die. “Cities are just a collection of important firms that drive economic activity in the area. When those firms struggle, so does the city. Understanding when and why politicians react differently to these struggles can give us insight into how quickly or slowly cities can recover”. In his courses, he seeks to develop understanding of underlying political contexts in his students. “Understanding what incentivizes political actors to favor or discriminate against firms has far reaching applications to businesses worldwide. When you can know what drives politicians decisions, you can know how viable your business will be within these contexts”.

    "clean_text":"Whether it is to motivate managers to act on a change in the climate of their industry or to analyze the extent to which financial markets lead companies to implement strategic changes, is interested in cause-and-effect analysis. After working for several years in a multinational company, Professor found that his day job made it more difficult to delve deeper into the business topics that interested him. He decided to devote himself to his doctoral studies. Equipped with his new academic experience, his work focuses on identifying the elements that create value in companies. In the case of financial markets, for instance, Professor believes that the impact of stock prices on companies and industries is an understudied field of management. He has found that stock prices influence the behavior of companies, especially when it comes to investment strategies. “And this influence is not necessarily positive,” he says. “Financial markets place a value on companies' strategies, but this is just their point of view and they could be wrong. Now, when a customer makes a purchase you do get real feedback”. In addition, Professor is developing a line of research on the management of large companies with a focus on Corporate Environmental Management. Protecting the environment is a very important goal in today's society. The performance of companies increasingly depends on their ability to protect nature and to sell to environmentally conscious consumers. Professor 's research shows that although companies perform better financially when they take care of the environment, shareholders are not always aware of this. It is then up to managers to implement the necessary strategies. This, however, requires the implementation of certain types of governance mechanisms. Professor also recently expanded research on governance and value creation by looking at topics such as sharia scholars in international banking and the effects of psychopathic CEOs. When teaching, Professor invites his students to take an unbiased look at what they are being taught. “It's crucial to understand a few things about the game that takes place,” he says. “And to do what is necessary to analyze the causal processes, the evolution of the what and the why…” Academic Experience • Senior Scholar in Strategy, IE University, Spain, 2003 – Present • Research Assistant, Wharton, USA, 1996 – 2003 • Recitation Teacher, Wharton, USA, 1997 – 1999 • Member of the “Academy of Management” and the “Strategic Management Society” Academic Background • PhD in Management Science, Wharton, University of Pennsylvania, USA, 2003 • Master of Science in Management, Wharton, University of Pennsylvania, USA, 2003 • Diploma in Business Administration, Philipps Universität Marburg, Germany, 1996 Corporate Experience • Project Manager, Marketing Ice Cream, Langnese-Iglo GmbH, Unilever Germany, 1995 – 1996 • Sales Group Manager, Sales Depot Berlin-East, Langnese-Iglo GmbH, Unilever Germany, 1994 – 1995 • Management Trainee Sales and Marketing, Langnese-Iglo GmbH, Unilever Germany, 1993 – 1994",

He completed his PhD in Government and Social Policy at Harvard University and was a postdoctoral research fellow at The Europe Center at the Freeman Spogli Institute at Stanford His research interests lie at the intersection of political economy and policy, particularly education policy, as well as health and education and environmental policies. Part of his work has been concerned with understanding what sustains and enhances robust human capital formation and the role that the political process may play in facilitating or impeding its development in different contexts. Over the last 20 years or so, the skills that countries have been investing in since World War II such as universal K-12 are becoming insufficient due to automation and delocalization of production and a job market inequality into highly rewarding high-skilled jobs and manual jobs. What drives successful nations, subnational units and companies to use education to tackle that challenge? He studies the role that politics broadly understood plays in these dynamics. This includes the jurisdictional configurations and institutions (such as decentralization in school districts and funding rules), as well as public opinion, media, and interest groups. He has also recently focused on the particular challenges facing higher education and adult education.

With these words, Professor describes the philosophy that has guided his 25 years of experience. He specialises in personal leadership, leadership of teams, and change management, and now he wants to tap this knowledge to research management styles and team management more deeply, an area in which he is already very involved. In his own words: “I want to carry out a good dissection of management styles, but from the point of view of collaborators. Management is always evaluated from a ‘top down’ perspective, but not the other way round”. This focus has enabled Professor to detect different styles of management. Each one is valid for a specific moment or phase of a project. “I am also deepening my research into essential roles within an efficient work team, and how much they are needed in each situation”. Professor holds a degree in Social Psychology from Madrid’s Universidad Complutense. He also has extensive experience in teaching and as a training consultant, which he is now using as a platform on which to base his research. “For example, I’ve worked on many 360º feedback processes, enabling me to detect gaps in companies between their actual situation and that the one they aspire to. Hence I can now gauge far better the kind of training needed”. Some of the companies with which he has worked are: Adecco, Airbus, Banesto, Bankinter, BBVA, Centre for Nuclear Security, Ferrovial, Grupo Santander, Inditex, Indra, Iberdrola, Nuffield College (Oxford), Pfizer, Sanitas, Ternium, Universidad de los Andes o Uralita. All this experience is serving him well in the two new cases he is now preparing on management and conflict in teams, combining this work with his responsibilities managing IE Business School´s Centre for Leadership and his teaching of leadership and organisational behaviour at IE Business School.

Those were years during which the club was going through a dramatic brand expansion. “Real Madrid is (and expected to be) a pioneer”, he says. “Apart from Manchester United, no team has ever had an understanding of how you can develop the emotional relationships with a football brand”. What really interests Prof from a marketing standpoint is the fact that, while in the US sport is conceived as entertainment, emotional attachment is what drives sports consumers in Europe. “That’s interesting in the way you segment the sport market and develop a marketing strategy, because it’s not based on income levels but on the commitment to the team”, he says. “This is an underdeveloped area but it is evolving, and in the next few years marketing efforts are going to be increasingly focused on understanding how consumers relate to sports”. At the same time, Prof is examining the way sporting events can help countries, cities or companies to position themselves and create a brand image. He cites the example of the America’s Cup and the opportunity it presents for city officials and local organisations to create a brand for Valencia. Prof believes that his work on sports marketing has broader implications for the corporate world. “I bring insights into sports marketing, sponsorships and promotions”, he says. “But these areas are certainly applicable to other areas of business”.

    "clean_text":"She studied Law and Business Administration being originally more interested in the business branch, but she started working as a lawyer and she loved it. Notwithstanding, she has not been out of the business world not only because the majority of her clients are companies, but also because she teaches accounting for lawyers, as far as she considers that a company lawyer that cannot understand accounting, is not in a good position to give proper and complete legal advice to his corporate client. In her lessons she not only explains the accounting subject, but she links it with her professional experience as lawyer as well, mentioning real cases that help her students to understand the accounting subject and to get interest about it. With this aim to train lawyers with some added value, she has taught lessons in which corporate, accountancy and tax matters were all mixed in a sole case, in order to make the students solve it from all those perspectives. As a lawyer she is interested in civil law, corporate law, bankruptcy law, economical crimes and litigation, dealing with cases that very often involve some of these areas at the same time. She has been Secretary of ICADE Asociación and, throughout the law office LEXINTER ABOGADOS (where she works), she is also a part of the international lawyers network “International Jurists”.

I hate ivory towers”. Prof is also among those who see blogging as a new and important forum through which to air and exchange academic ideas. He is also an avid consumer of information and keeps up with the latest developments in information systems via dozens of online newspapers and journals. However, this approach comes as no surprise, since the interests pursued by Prof include the new economy, the effects of technology on consumer behaviour and the consequences of new technological developments for business in general. His ideas and research on these areas have been published in international magazines and Prof ' articles about new technologies and their application to the business world appear regularly in the general and financial press - and, of course, on his website. “There's a lot to talk about these days”, he says.

    "clean_text":"Dr. Sanchez-Andrea holds a PhD in Microbiology from the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM, Spain) which she defended with honours ( cum laude and awarded with the Extraordinary Doctorate Prize of the Faculty of Sciences). During her PhD, she performed two internship in world-wide reference laboratories, staying 5 months in 2010 in the Laboratory for marine Microbiology in Bremen (Germany), and 6 months in 2011 in the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Netherlands. She mastered (culture-independent) molecular biology techniques based on 16S rRNA gene microbial communities profiling and culture-dependent techniques. As a result of her PhD, she proposed and validated a geomicrobiological model of the functioning of S, Fe, C and N cycles on the anaerobic sediments of Tinto river, an extreme acidic environment. She pioneeringly showed the complexity of the system in contradiction with the relative simplicity observed in the water column. She also demonstrated successfully the application of native Tinto river microbiota to remediate mine drainage water coupled to wastewater. Then, she received a NASA Planetary Biology Internship award to work on microbial electrosynthesis in the laboratory of Prof. Kenneth Nealson in the University of South California, in Los Angeles. In her three consecutive a Post-Doctoral positions (2012-2017) at the Laboratory of Microbiology of the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) she expanded her knowledge on the enrichment, isolation and characterization of microbes (with focus on specialized anaerobic techniques), and in physiology and biochemistry. She became an independent Principal Investigator (PI) leading the sulfur cycle group, which focuses on the study of microorganisms related with the sulfur cycle, with a special interest in acidophiles and their application to biotechnological processes. As so, in 2017, she became Assistant Professor (UD2) and one year afterwards, she was promoted to UD1 based on merits. By 2023, she published 63 research articles being the first author of 14, last author of 24 and corresponding author of 27, publishing in top journals as Science , Nature Communications , etc. Her research on acidophilic environments linked with mining activities resulted in the discovery of 4 novel genera and 3 novel species which are key microbial players in attenuation processes with application for bioremediation. The famous video channel VICE Motherboard featured her Research in a documentary 1 (see link) with further publication in Tweeter, Instagram and Facebook. She aims to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which acidophiles withstand extreme conditions by applying a wide array of omics techniques (meta)genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, as well as biochemical characterization of enzymes. She has discovered novel pathways in the nitrogen, sulfur and carbon cycles. Worth of special mention is her discovery of the 7 th pathway for CO 2 fixation, the glycine reductive pathway, in the sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. Here, her role went from the idea generation, funding acquisition and laboratory experimentation. This text-book changing discovery received a lot of attention for what she got the Research award 2021 from Wageningen Fund Academy for the best paper of the year and was interviewed for journals AS Resource and Wageningen World. She has secured funding being awarded with 5 research proposals as PI counting with an impressive international collaborative network of reknown scientists and in collaboration with companies. She has mentor in her group 3 technicians, 2 post-docs and 8 PhD students. Three of her PhD students already defended their doctoral thesis and they currently secured postdoctoral positions or fixed Jobs in reseach institutes or companies. Dr. Sanchez-Andrea has being involved for 15 years in educational activities as coordinator and\/or lecturer in Master and Bachelor’s courses. She also organizes the biannual EMBO Practical Course: Breathless microbes 2 on anaerobic cultivation techniques and is keenly organizing conferences or symposiums such as Novel Anaerobes 3 . She has been active in dissemination activities such as writing a blog 4 for Oxford University Press Blog making a case in support of implementing innovative bio-processes in the metal mining industry, or collaborating in books such as Afvalwater, hoe maken we de cirkel weer rond? 5 . Her expertise is reflected in editorial activities having edited several special issues for top journals such as Current Opinion in Biotechnology, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology etc. Furthermore she has served as editorial board member of Applied and Environmental Microbiology , and Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution , Genetics and Microbiology. She is involved as reviewer of project proposals for the National Science Foundation of USA, Czech Science Foundation, etc. She is a highly social person who enjoys team work and to build up a good working atmosphere. She enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and is passionate for Nature, fauna, flora and the little microbes which nobody see but they drive the biogeochemical cycles.

Previously, I have worked at Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, ITAM in Mexico City, BI in Oslo, UPF in Barcelona, Stern-NYU in New York, and the McCombs School of Business at UT Austin. My teaching interests include Corporate Finance, Valuation and Portfolio Management in undergraduate, MBAs and Executive Programs. The overarching topic of my research is compensation incentives. I have studied how to design the compensation of mutual fund portfolio managers (with an emphasis in understanding the role of performance benchmarks) and how to explain the contracts that we observe in practice in the light of agency and contract theory. I also have made contributions on mutual fund performance and fees, corporate governance in developing countries, and executive compensation. Currently, I am interested in ESG metrics in executive compensation, and pay-inequality within firms and its relation with firm performance. My work has been published in Economic Theory, Finance Research Letters, Journal of Finance, Journal of Finance and Quantitative Analysis, and Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, among other academic outlets.

It was this intuition that made , a fully trained theoretical economist, see accounting as a way for companies to transform raw data into information useful for internal and external decision makers. However abstract this idea may seem at the beginning, it is actually at the core of the recent developments in accounting practice.

On a broader scale she is interested in supporting digital studies of under-resourced and under-represented languages. Hence, she first co-founded the Islamicate Digital Humanities Network to organise international conferences online every year for scholars to share their latest research and methods in the study of Islam and its languages, such as Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Turkish, or Urdu for instance. And following her fellowship at the Centre for Digital Humanities at Princeton, she became the co-chair of DARIAH Multilingual DH Working group. Previously she studied German, Russian as well as Translation in Geneva, and worked as a professional translator for national and international organisations, authors and artists. In parallel, she did a Master in Islamic studies and History at Oxford and, in her doctoral thesis, delved into the origins of the Islamic call to prayer and the premises of Muslim cultural memory. She then contributed to the ERC project KITAB (Knowledge, Information, Technology and the Arabic Book) towards the development of the OpenITI corpus, the largest, open-source digital collection of Classical Arabic texts.

    "clean_text":"The last decade he spent researching and consulting in the area of customer management had a profound effect on ’s thinking as a marketing professor at IE Business School. Those were years during which the corporate world finally realized the necessity to shift from a transaction based to a relationship based marketing. What really interests Prof from a marketing standpoint is the management of customer relationships in order to increase a firm’s long-term profitability. “Customers are important intangible assets of a firm that should be valued and managed”, he says. “Only by attracting, retaining, and growing profitable customer relationships firms will be successful in the future”. His research therefore aims to provide managerial implications on how to build profitable and long-lasting customer relationships. His primary concern is to quantify the impact of various customer management activities on a customer’s lifetime value – the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over a customer’s lifetime. At the same time, Prof develops analytical models to estimate or approximate a customer’s lifetime value. “One of the major challenges in customer relationship management is still to arrive at reliable estimates of a customer’s future profits and lifetime”, he says. “Not being able to measure a customer’s lifetime value prevents the development of successful strategies for customer management”. Prof believes that his work on customer relationship management has broad implications for the corporate world. “I intend to develop insights on how to satisfy customer needs, but at the same time to consider the monetary consequences of doing so,” he says. “This will provide firms with a roadmap for growth”.

In the words of Professor , \"In order for a process as complex and uncertain as negotiation to reach a satisfactory result, a methodology is needed to structure and to provide foresight and control to the negotiator's behavior. “Our differential aspect is that we understand that the negotiation process implies a gain in itself. Throughout these years, we have worked on a single framework which, on the one hand, makes the results-oriented task as efficient as possible and, on the other hand, optimizes the possibilities of mutual knowledge, value creation, and ethical and personal growth at the negotiating table.\" With a degree in Law from the Central University of Barcelona, Professor worked for ten years in the commercial department of the José Mario Armero Law Firm, carrying out all kinds of corporate transactions. She worked extensively in fields such as capital increases, mergers and acquisitions, sponsorship contracts, strategic alliances, joint venture and advertising processes, and many more.

The first of them is leadership because she considers good leadership skills to be crucial for our professional lives as much as our personal lives, as she says: “a good leader knows not only how to speak to others’ minds, but also how to touch their hearts”. Her curiosity for leadership led her to discover her second passion: qualitative research. After all, as she states, how can we understand leadership without carrying out research that allows us to make sense of the rich complexities of leadership? She explored leadership by conducting interviews with the most effective CEOS of IBEX 35 and the main political leaders of Spain and Lithuania and working at Harvard University as a visiting researcher. Over the past fifteen years, she has dedicated herself to not only conducting qualitative research on leadership but also providing training and support to others. Definitely, teaching is her third passion.

During his doctoral research at Wageningen University & Research (Wageningen, the Netherlands) and his post-doctoral research at Wetsus Institute (Leeuwarden, the Netherlands), he studied how to use microorganisms for the degradation of undesirable substances in wastewater or for the production of valuable resources from waste streams ‑ preferably for both simultaneously. His main interests were in microbial methane and sulfide oxidation for water treatment, for which he has collaborated since the start of his PhD with environmental technologists. Afterwards, he worked at KWR water research (Nieuwegein, the Netherlands) where he investigated current and novel drinking water treatment and management processes with a specific focus on microbiology and nature-based solutions, that possibly lead to new applications for climate-resilient water treatment and management. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of his research, he collaborated with technologists, hydrologists, analytical chemists and data scientists. has been working closely with the Dutch drinking water companies at KWR, their central research institute. He also worked with waterboards, municipalities and wastewater treatment companies throughout his career. In the last 5 years, he also coordinated a joint research program for the water companies that use managed aquifer recharge of surface water for drinking water production. Because has been doing applied research, he has not only published peer-reviewed papers, but also professional articles and over 30 scientific reports for water companies, waterboards and municipalities. Ever since, he strives to perform applied research that makes a difference in the way that we perceive and execute water treatment. He strongly believes that a paradigm shift is needed for sustainable water treatment, where we stop underestimating the power of (micro)biology.

    "clean_text":"“Spanish managers are sociable, competent and political, but they lack vision and the capacity to motivate the team”. This is how , professor of human resources at IE, summarises her conclusions based on two decades of experience in the field of human resources. Following an extensive career in the world of consulting, she joined IE in 2001 to help promote competence-driven executive development programmes. “As I am from the world of consulting, I am very used to preparing material for training purposes, and customising it to meet the needs of each firm. I craft, rather than build programmes”. Practical and innovative, she designs her programmes so as to provide measurable results. She acquired this philosophy while working with management teams in the sales’ departments of several different companies, frequently raising their sales by as much as 56%. She applies this same promise to her in-company, skill-building, and general development programmes where she teaches at IE. Companies she has worked with include Roche, Aena, Pfizer, Iberdrola, Airbus, the Board for Nuclear Security or Madrid’s Regional Authorities. She is now immersed in research into management styles, based on a sample of 436 executives. “We will use the results to determine the skills they need to develop more, and what they do best”, says professor . She has also written the Gustavo Garrido case, “a manager who doesn’t know how to manage himself, and consequently, can’t manage his team”. Professor holds a Master in Business Administration and Human Resource Management and a degree in industrial sociology of work from Madrid’s Complutense University. She has authored several articles for specialised journals and in different communication media. Prior to working for IE , she headed training at Radiobip and Vivavoce, Telefónica’s main distributor, which was acquired by The Phone House. From there, she moved on to Telefónica Data.

    "clean_text":"Professor of Information Systems at IE, Professor has combined an extensive professional career with one of deep research into the field of new technologies. This dual profile, coupled with fifteen years of experience, has made him a recognized authority in the rapid evolution of the sector. During the early years of interne, he studied leading Spanish start-ups such as Olé, Barrabes, Teknoland, Netjuice, and served as consultant for companies like Telefónica, Telefónica Data, Microsoft, HP, CECA or the Norwegian Bank Association. In his own words: “The cases I did on Olé, Netjuice, etc, were noticed by MIT, which was interested in researching the possibilities that new forms of information integration offered business corporations, and, in turn, the rapid evolution of traditional information systems”. “Now I want to replicate the work model of the department where I worked in MIT, here at IE. This means researching highly specific aspects and applying them to organizations.” In order to achieve this, Professor maintains close relations with counterparts at the University of New York, Carnegie Mellon and MIT. He wants to see how companies use technology to relate among themselves and thus foresee the changes that these relations will undergo as new technological architectures emerge. This challenge, he tells us “produces differentiated research from Spain and Europe, rather than importing the US model into Spain.” This local approach to an international scenario from a business perspective rather than a technological one, is the DNA of Professor ’s research activity. He is also using his experience at MIT to the full to develop a doctoral programme in information systems for companies, at the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros Industriales de la Universidad de Madrid.

Her research empirically explores how recent changes in the labor market towards more flexible organizations are affecting employment outcomes. One stream of her research looks at the effects of the adoption of flexible workforce practices on firm level outcomes. Her more recent projects in this area have explored the labor productivity consequences of having a workforce geographically distributed or of having fluid team organizations. She is currently investigating the performance and turnover consequences of using temporary workers in the organization. “What we are finding is that there is a dark side of using labor flexibility practices. Using temps may be cheaper, but it can importantly erode the human and social capital of the organization”. Another stream of her research focuses on investigating the determinants of career advancement. She has explored how innovative work organizational practices that empower employees have affected promotions within organizations. Her ongoing research in the area of careers explores the drivers of career success in the growing context of inter-organizational mobility. In particular, she is investigating the role of MBA educational credentials and prior employer status in generating job matches and compensation. Professor ‘s research has appeared in several academic publications. She has also presented her work at multiple international conferences.

In his own words: “I am currently researching the role of information technologies in the business organization, their relevance as an engine for innovation and transformation, and how they are managed”. He is also interested in the development of new markets and services in digital convergence, studying, for example, how mobiles and interactive television are moving toward each others’ territory, permitting young people to arrange to meet through teletext messages. Furthermore, professor has researched the theoretical concept of digital convergence. From a more practical perspective, he has also studied the management of information systems in Spanish firms, and, in collaboration with MIT, the definition of new services on mobile platforms. The common denominator of all these issues is the relation between technology and innovation in transforming markets, business organisations and their people. His role as Chief Innovation Officer at IE is indeed closely linked to these interests. As part of his research activities, Professor Aragon has collaborated with ENTER, IE’s Center for Telecommunications and the Information Society, focusing his analysis on the evolution of digital convergence and mainly on evaluating the impact of disruptive technologies. Prior to this, in the Information Management Research Centre (IMRC), an IE initiative carried out jointly with Accenture, he was studying the management of information systems, specifically in the area that has come to be called IT governance. He has also focused his interest in trends on the use and management of CRM in the Spanish firm. Professor combines this activity with research projects and reports on supply and demand of qualified employment in Spain which, since 1998 he has published in Infoempleo.com. “This work enables me to analyse how the job market shows the technological and organizational changes taking place in businesses”.

Using Spain’s extensive archives he has been tracing the history of manufactories like the Royal Tobacco Factory of Seville and what he believes is an early form of just-in-time production. “Some 250 years ago, this factory nearly represented 30 per cent of total royal income, and that meant the best of all managerial knowledge was in this factory”, he says. “So by looking at ancient systems one can find insights into contemporary practices”. When it comes to contemporary practices, Prof is well versed in management and accounting control, management structures and the implementation of ERPs. In his teaching, he is particularly interested in giving students a very holistic view of topics such as performance indicators and what drives changes in management accounting systems. “International MBA or executive MBA students are going to hold general management responsibilities”, he says. “So they need to know about the technical aspects of accounting, but also about how that will influence their vision and managerial skills”. In addition to teaching, carrying out his duties as Dean for Faculty Affairs and Rector of IE University and writing for professional journals and magazines, Prof engages in consultancy work for corporations as well as conducting executive training and in-company programmes that are aimed at the top-level management of multinational enterprises. Prof served as Editor of the European Accounting Review, a premier accounting journal, and as Senior Editor of Oxford Research Reviews.

    "clean_text":"Alvaro is an innovator, researcher, technology fan, Professor of Information Systems, and Director of the Department of Information Systems and Technologies at IE Business School. He holds a M.Sc. and a D.Phil. in Computation from Oxford University, as well as a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Systems Engineering and Computation from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. Alvaro´s main research interest lies in trust and security in distributed information systems. In his view, “the globalization of business requires the interoperation of systems between enterprises; but there is a resistance to such interoperability due to a lack of trust of alien systems, and a reticence to expose corporate systems to new risks – especially security risks”. Alvaro´s research work has focused on tackling this challenge by applying trust and risk management techniques in order to secure distributed collaborations. His research has been published in a number of top tier academic journals. Highlight of some of his research work includes models for reputation management in service computing; trust management in virtual organizations and business collaborations; security requirements for large-scale distributed systems; and usage control in business processes. Alvaro has been active in the European Research Area. He is currently a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the EU Contrail project and leads the topic of “trust and security in large-scale distributed systems” within the ERCIM CoreGRID Working Group. He was the scientific coordinator of the EU GridTrust project, led the security work in the EU XtreemOS project, and the Virtual Organization Management work in the EU TrustCoM project. Before joining IE Business School, Alvaro was a senior research scientist at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in the UK, leading the Distributed Systems Team at the STFC e-Science Centre. Previously, he was Head of the Information Technology Group at the Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga in Colombia.

    "clean_text":"The very hands-on attitude towards business and industry is what distinguishes the philosophy of Angel , whether that’s applied to his teaching, writing or research. “I believe that in the business we have to be practical”, he says. “You need a conceptual framework, but this framework has to work in the real world”. It was his time spent working in industry and the private sector – including experience as a maintenance manager for a water supply system and a metro system, and consulting contracts in the oil, steel and aluminum industries – that gave Prof many of his insights into the implementation not only of Operations Management and Logistics but also of Information Technology. “What’s really interesting is to realise that every implementation has two sides”, he says. “One is technical and involves processes, and the other is organisational. And you shouldn’t take these apart – you need an integrated view of the organisation”. And his views on operations management, logistics and information technology systems, have been aired in more than 40 publications – among them the International Journal of Logistics and the European Journal of Operations Research – as well as in his three books.

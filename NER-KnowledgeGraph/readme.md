# NER–KnowledgeGraph

### Instructions for Running and Visualizing the Project

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks in the file ./notebooks/:

1. **01_load_and_clean.ipynb** – Processes the raw professor profiles, runs NER, normalizes entities, and outputs a structured JSON file.
2. **02_build_graph.ipynb** – Builds a knowledge graph from the cleaned data and exports GraphML/GEXF/CSV files for visualization in Gephi.

**Run everything on a clean machine by simply clicking “Run All”** in each notebook.

**Visualise graph using Gephi** https://lite.gephi.org/v1.0.1/

- Upload ./outputs/graph/prof_kg_sample.graphml or prof_kg.graphml and have fun!
